Dependencies Specification:
  The build settings file:"dependencies" file follows the code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)" format.

  Each Object represents a specific project name as it would be linked against.
  Each Content represents associated information, such as a version number.
  Future versions of this will clarify what and how Content, such as version numbers, are to be used and processed.

  This file is originally intended for dependencies provided by the FLL:"Featureless Linux Library" project.
  Order matters, and the provided order represents the order of dependencies.
  The first entry therefore has no preceding dependency and the last dependency could potentially depend on all dependencies above it.
