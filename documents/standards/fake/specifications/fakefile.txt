Fakefile Specification:
  The file:"fakefile" file follows the code:"FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List)" format with a sub-format of code:"IKI-0002 (Simple Script)".

  A file:"fakefile" is broken up into multiple bold:"Basic Lists", referred to as bold:"Sections", with two special purpose reserved bold:"Sections".
  The bold:"Sections" are broken up into multiple bold:"Extended Objects" and their respective bold:"Contents", referred to as bold:"Section Operations".

  Each of these non-reserved Sections acts as a set to perform some set of bold:"Section Operations".
  Each of these bold:"Section Operations" perform a single command or action based on a set of reserved bold:"Section Operation" types.
  Each of these bold:"Section Operations" have a set of bold:"Arguments" associated with them.

  How these bold:"Arguments" are interpreted and processed are specific to each bold:"Operation" type.
  The bold:"Section Operations" are represented by the bold:"Extended Object" name and the bold:"Extended Content" represents the bold:"Operation Arguments".
  Each of these bold:"Section Operations" support bold:"IKI" variable substitution within their respective bold:"Arguments".
  The bold:"Operation Extended Object" does not support bold:"IKI" variable substitution.
  The reserved bold:"Settings Section" does not support bold:"IKI" variable substitution.

  The code:"IKI-0002 (Simple Script)" vocabulary context is further clarified as follows\:
    - code:"context": The value is case-sensitive variable name.
    - code:"define": The value must be a case-sensitive valid environment variable name (alpha-numeric or underscore, but no leading digits).
    - code:"parameter": The value is a case-sensitive variable name.
      - Many parameters also support code:":option" and code:":value" appended at the end of the value.

  The reserved bold:"Section Objects" are\:
    - code:"settings": contains a list of bold:"Settings Objects" and bold:"Content" in code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)" format.
    - code:"main:" contains a list of bold:"Operation Objects" and bold:"Content" in code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)" format.

  The bold:"Settings Objects" are\:
    - code:"compiler": Only one bold:"Content", which must only be a valid filename.
    - code:"define": First bold:"Content" represents variable name (case-sensitive), remaining bold:"Content" represents the value.
    - code:"environment": Zero or more bold:"Content" representing valid environment variable names (alpha-numeric with underscore, but cannot begin with a number).

  The code:"if" bold:"Section Operation" conditions and numbers\:
    The numbers may be represented in any of the forms\:
      1) code:"decimal": all numbers without a base-type prefix are of base-type 10, referred to as decimal.
      2) code:"binary": all numbers with the prefix code:"0b" (uppercase or lowercase character:'b') are of base-type 2, referred to as binary.
      3) code:"octal": all numbers with the prefix code:"0o" (that is zero followed by the letter character:'o', uppercase or lowercase character:'o') are of base-type 8, referred to as octal.
      4) code:"duodecimal": all numbers with the prefix code:"0d" (uppercase or lowercase character:'d') are of base-type 12, referred to as duodecimal.
      5) code:"hexadecimal": all numbers with the prefix code:"0x" (uppercase or lowercase character:'x') are of base-type 16, referred to as hexadecimal.

    (At this time) The numbers may be of a max value of 2^64, or 18446744073709551615, positive or negative.
    (At this time) The numbers may only be whole numbers.
    Note: There are plans to impose no limits on the number size or any decimal values, but this requires significant work is not to be implemented at this time.
    Once this restriction is lifted, it should be conditional upon an implementation for what the maximum supported numbers or digits may be.

    Only the following code:"if" Section Operation conditions use these operators\:
      - code:">"
      - code:"<"
      - code:">="
      - code:"<="

  The code:"if" bold:"Section Operation" condition code:"parameter"\:
    The following reserved words are available for parameter names: code:"build", code:"color", code:"current", code:"data", code:"define", code:"fakefile", code:"mode", code:"process", code:"return", code:"settings", code:"sources", code:"top", code:"verbosity", and code:"work".
    Each of the reserved words supports having code:":option" and code:":value" appended, such as: code:"work:value".
