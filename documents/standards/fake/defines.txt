Defines Specification:
  The build settings bold:"defines" file follows the code:"FSS-0000 (Basic)" format.

  Each Object represents a specific a macro name to be defined during compilation.
  Each Content represents documentation explaining the intent and purpose of that define.

  The Object name has further restrictions than code:"FSS-0000" requires.
  These restrictions are that the Object must only evaluate to a valid C/C++ macro name.
  This is essentially means only Word characters.
