Featureless Settings Specification: 0003 - Extended List:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and white space to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  An open-brace '{' (U+007B) followed by any white space until a newline terminates a possible valid Object.
  An Object is not considered fully valid until a valid close-brace '}' (U+007D) is found, designating the end of the Content.
  Non-white space printable characters may not follow the open-brace of a valid Object.

  Content is represented as a single Content column of every line following a valid object until the end of file (or string) or until a non-delimited close-brace '}'.
  Any Content column that could be interpreted as an end of Content must be delimited if it should be part of the Content.
  White space may follow a valid close-brace but a terminating newline must be present to designate a valid end of Content.

  There is no single-quote or double-quote delimitation in this specification.
  Only the open-brace that would result in a valid Object or the close-brace that would terminate valid Content can be delimited.
  When inside potentially valid Content (which follows a valid Object) the open-brace cannot be delimited because this standard is not-recursive.
  When not inside any potentially valid Content (that is, there is no previous unclosed Object), then the Object may be delimited.
  Likewise, the close-brace may only be delimited if it is within any potentially valid Content.

  Each delimit slash in a delimitable open-brace is treated as a potential delimit such that two slashes represents a single delimited slash ("\\{" would represent "\{").
  Only the first delimit slash in a delimitable close-brace is treated as a potential delimit ("\\\}" would represent "\\}").

  Empty Objects are allowed, that is, the length of the object may be zero.

  Key\:
    "\s" = White space, except newline.
    "\o" = Any printable character, except unescaped '{' (U+007B).
    "\l" = Any printable character or white space, except unescaped '}' (U+007D).
    "\c" = Either white space or printable, including newline, that is not interpretable as an Object.
    "\n" = Newline.
    "*" = Zero or more occurrences.

  Before Structure\:
    ""

  Structure\:
    "\s*\o\l*{\s*\n\c*\n\s*}\s*\n"

  After Structure\:
    ""

  Example\:
    # fss-0003
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" {
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      \}
    }

    Second {
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All white space, including newline (and leading white space) is "part of content."
      # Valid comments are still ignored.
    }

  Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
         This: does not need to be delimited.
         }
    2.1) Continues until EOS/EOF.
         All white space, including newline (and leading white space) is "part of content."
