Featureless Settings Specification: 0003 - Extended List:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  An open-brace ({) followed by any whitespace until a newline terminates a possible valid Object.
  An Object is not considered fully valid until a valid close-brace (}) is found, designating the end of the Content.
  Non-whitespace may not follow the open-brace of a valid Object.

  Content is represented as a single Content column of every line following a valid object until the end of file (or string) or until a non-delimited close-brace (}).
  Any Content column that could be interpreted as an end of Content must be delimited if it should be part of the Content.
  Whitespace may follow a valid close-brace but a terminating newline must be present to designate a valid end of Content.

  There is no single-quote or double-quote delimitation in this specification.
  Only the open-brace that would result in a valid Object or the close-brace that would terminate valid Content can be delimited.
  When inside potentially valid Content (which follows a valid Object) the open-brace cannot be delimited because this standard is not-recursive.
  When not inside any potentially valid Content (that is, there is no previous unclosed Object), then the Object may be delimited.
  Likelwise, the close-brace may only be delimited if it is within any potentially valid Content.

  Each delimit slash in a delimitable open-brace is treated as a potential delimit such that two slashes represents a single delimited slash ('\\{' would represent '\{').
  Only the first delimit slash in a delimitable close-brace is treated as a potential delimit ('\\\}' would represent '\\}').

  Empty Objects are allowed, that is, the length of the object may be 0.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \o = any printable character, except unescaped '{'.
    \l = any printable character or whitespace, except unescaped '}'.
    \c = either whitespace or printable, including newline, that is not interpretable as an Object.
    \n = newline.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.

  Before Structure\:

  Structure\:
    \s*\o\l*{\s*\n\c*\n\s*}\s*\n

  After Structure\:

  Example\:
    # fss-0003
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" {
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      \}
    }

    Second {
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is "part of content."
      # Valid comments are still ignored.
    }

  Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
         This: does not need to be delimited.
         }
    2.1) Continues until EOS/EOF.
         All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is "part of content."
