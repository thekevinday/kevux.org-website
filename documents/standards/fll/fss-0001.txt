Featureless Settings Specification: 0001 - Extended:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  Whitespace separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be followed by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing whitespace follows a valid Object, that Object is considered to have no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as multiple Content columns.
  Content columns are whitespace separated parts within the Content and terminated by a newline.
  Any number of Content columns may exist in the Content until the newline is reached.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \b = either whitespace or printable, except newline.
    \q = non-whitespace or quoteded whitespace, no whitespace outside of quotes.
    \n = newline.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.
    + = one or more occurrences.
    ()* = grouping that repeats 0 or more times.
