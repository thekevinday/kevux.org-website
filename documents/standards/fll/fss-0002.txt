# Note: This file is in fss-0002 format and as a result the example below has to be escaped (can potentially be confusing when reading this raw).
#       The "This Does\\\:" below is actually "This Does\:" when processed by fss-0002.

Featureless Settings Specification: 0002 - Basic List:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  A colon followed by any whitespace until a newline terminates a valid Object.
  Non-whitespace may not follow the colon of a valid Object.

  Content is represented as a single Content column of every line following a valid object until the end of file (or string) or until the next valid Object is found.
  Any Content that could be interpreted as a valid Object must have the colon delimited.

  There is no single-quote or double-quote delimitation in this specification.
  Only the colon that would result in a valid Object can be delimited.

  Empty Objects are allowed, that is, the length of the object may be 0.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \o = any printable character, except unescaped ':'.
    \l = any printable character or whitespace, except unescaped ':'.
    \c = either whitespace or printable, including newline, that not interpretable as an Object.
    \n = newline.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.

  Structure\:
    \s*\o\l*:\s*\n\c*\n*

  After Structure\:

  Example\:
    # fss-0002
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object"\:
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      This Does\\\:
    Second\:
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is "part of content."
      # Valid comments are still ignored.

  Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
         This: does not need to be delimited.
         This Does\:
    2.1) Continues until EOS/EOF.
         All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is "part of content."
