Featureless Settings Specification: 0002 - Basic List:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and white space to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  A colon ':' (U+003A) followed by any white space until a newline terminates a valid Object.
  Non-white space printable characters may not follow the colon of a valid Object.

  Content is represented as a single Content column of every line following a valid object until the end of file (or string) or until the next valid Object is found.
  Any Content that could be interpreted as a valid Object must have the colon delimited.

  There is no single-quote or double-quote delimitation in this specification.
  Only the colon that would result in a valid Object can be delimited.

  Empty Objects are allowed, that is, the length of the object may be zero.

  Key\:
    "\s" = White space, except newline.
    "\o" = Any printable character, except unescaped ':' (U+003A).
    "\l" = Any printable character or white space, except unescaped ':' (U+003A).
    "\c" = Either white space or printable, including newline, that not interpretable as an Object.
    "\n" = Newline.
    "*" = Zero or more occurrences.

  Example\:
    # fss-0002
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object"\:
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      This Does\\\:
    Second\:
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All white space, including newline (and leading white space) is "part of content."
      # Valid comments are still ignored.

  Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
         This: does not need to be delimited.
         This Does\:
    2.1) Continues until EOS/EOF.
         All white space, including newline (and leading white space) is "part of content."
