Featureless Settings Specification: 000B - Simple List:
  This might be similar to fss-0008 - Embedded List, except it is an fss-0003 Extended List with a (non-recursive) fss-0002 Basic List inside the Content.

  See the fss-0002.txt and fss-0003.txt specification files for details on the syntax rules.

  Example\:
    # fss-000b
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" {
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      \}
    }

    Second {
      Nested Example.

      Third:
        Fourth:
          There is parallel to Second rather than nested within Second.
    }

  Outer Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Inner Objects (depth 1) would be\:
    2.1) Third
    2.2) Fourth

  Inner Contents (depth 0) would be\:
    1.1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
           This: does not need to be delimited.
           }

    2.1.1) Nested Example.

           Third:
             Fourth:
               There is parallel to Second rather than nested within Second.

  Inner Contents (depth 1) would be\:
    2.1.1.1)
    2.2.1.1) There is parallel to Second rather than nested within Second.
