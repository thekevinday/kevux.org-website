IKI Specification: 0002 - Simple Script:
  This specification provides a small set of vocabulary names meant to be used for substitution in simple scripts.

  This specification only loosely defines the vocabulary context.
  This vocabulary may be further extended but must at least support the taxonomy defined here.
  Flexibility on interpretation is intended so that the context can be more fine-tuned and customized.

  The taxonomy for the context, define, and parameter are intentionally not defined here and left open.
  One utilizing this should document the taxonomy for each of these as desired.

  Vocabulary\:
  - context: Intended to be used for printing (or tagging) context codes before and after text, such as with color context.
  - define: Intended to be used for global properties, much like a C/C++ "#define".
  - parameter: Intended to be used for parameters or variables.

  See the iki.txt specification file for details on the syntax rules.
