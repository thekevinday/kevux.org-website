Featureless Settings Specification: 0000 - Basic:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and white space to the left of the Object is not treated as part of the object.
  White space separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be preceded by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing white spaces or non-printable characters follow a valid Object, then that Object is considered to have no Content.
  An Object may be quoted to include whitespace where a single quote character:"'" (unicode:"U+0027"), a double quote character:'"' (unicode:"U+0022"), or a backtick character:'`' (unicode:"U+0060") are used to quote.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as a single Content column terminated by a newline.
  Content column consists of everything following the first non-white space character until the newline.
  Content column includes trailing white space before newline is reached.
  Content column does not include any of the leading white space.
  No delimits are supported in the Content.

  Key\:
    code:"\s" = White space, except newline.
    code:"\b" = Either white space or printable, except newline.
    code:"\q" = Non-white space or quoted white space (and non-whitespace) with no white space outside of the quotes.
    code:"\n" = Newline.
    code:"*" = Zero or more occurrences.
    code:"+" = One or more occurrences.

  Before Structure\:
    code:""

  Structure\:
    code:"\s*\q+\s+\b*\n"

  After Structure\:
    code:""

  Example\:
    # fss-0000
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" Content until newline.
    Second object set.

  Object would be\:
    1) The Object
    2) Second

  Content would be\:
    1.1) Content until newline.
    2.1) object set.
