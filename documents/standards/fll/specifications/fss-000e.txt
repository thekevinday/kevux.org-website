Featureless Settings Specification: 000e - Payload:
  This is a code:"FSS-0002 (Basic List)" with two required objects\:
  1) italic:"header".
  2) italic:"payload".

  The italic:"header"\:
  - The italic:"header"'s Content is of type code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".
  - The italic:"header" is recommended to have the Objects italic:"length", italic:"status", italic:"part", and italic:"total".
  - The recommended italic:"length" represents the size of the italic:"payload".
  - The recommended italic:"part" represents a single part of a set of packets for when the data being transmitted is split across multiple payloads.
  - The recommended italic:"total" represents the total number of parts representing a complete data transmitted across multiple payloads.
  - The recommended italic:"status" represents status codes (such as success or failure) and multiple.
  - The Content for the recommended italic:"length" and italic:"status" are positive whole numbers (including zero) that may be in italic:"binary", italic:"octal", italic:"decimal", italic:"duodecimal", or italic:"hexidecimal" numerical format.

  The italic:"payload"\:
  - The italic:"payload"'s Content may contain anything, including raw binary data.
  - The italic:"payload" is italic:"required" to be the last list Object in the file.
  - The italic:"payload" is recommended to have its size designated in some manner in the italic:"header" (such as with the recommended italic:"length").
  - The italic:"payload" is terminated by the EOF:"End of File" character or by the recommended italic:"length" header.
  - The italic:"payload" may be empty (length may be zero), but the list Object italic:"payload" must still exist.
  - Nothing in the italic:"payload" may be considered a valid list Object by the outer code:"FSS-0002 (Basic List)" and therefore escaping is unnecessary (No further processing by the outer code:"FSS-0002 (Basic List)" is allowed at this point).
  - Comments in the italic:"payload" are not considered comments and are instead considered part of the payload, as-is.
  - Essentially, the italic:"payload" should be treated as binary data embedded in a text file.

  The recommended italic:"length" italic:"header" Object used to designate the italic:"payload" size does not necessarily have to be defined in the italic:"header".
  That is to say, if the italic:"payload" is expected to be of some pre-defined or static length then a length does not need to be provided in the italic:"header".

  The recommended italic:"status" italic:"header" Object may be a string, such as code:"F_none", or a positive whole number.
  What the status code represents is application specific (or specific to a sub-standard) but may often be used to represent FLL:"Featureless Linux Library" status code.
  - The FLL:"Featureless Linux Library" status code is a 16-bit digit whose first two high-order bits represent italic:"error" and italic:"warning" ( representing italic:"signal").
  - The FLL:"Featureless Linux Library" status code as a number is binary sensitive and may not be portable across binaries or systems.
  - For best portability, consider using status as a name string to ensure cross-system or cross-binary compatibility.

  Example\:
    # fss-000e
    # valid comments are ignored.
    header\:
      type error
      status 296
      length 30

    payload\:
    The program is out of memory.

  Outer Objects would be\:
    1) header
    2) payload

  "header" Objects would be\:
    1.1) type
    1.2) status
    1.3) length

  "header" Contents would be\:
    1.1.1) error
    1.2.1) 296
    1.3.1) 30

  The payload would be\:
    2) The program is out of memory.
