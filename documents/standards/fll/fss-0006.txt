Featureless Settings Specification: 0006 - Somewhat Extended List:
  This is a fss-0003 Extended List whose Content is then processed as fss-0000 Basic.

  All Extended List (fss-0003) escapes are applied before any Basic (fss-0000) is identified.

  See the fss-0000.txt and fss-0003.txt specification files for details on the syntax rules.

  Example\:
    # fss-0006
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" {
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      \}
    }

    Second {
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is "part of content."
      # Valid comments are still ignored.
    }
