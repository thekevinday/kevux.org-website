Featureless Settings Specification: 000e - Payload:
  This is a "FSS-0002 (Basic List)" with two required objects\:
  1) header.
  2) payload.

  The header\:
  - The header's Content is of type "FSS-0001 (Extended)".
  - The header is recommended to have the Objects length, status, part, and total.
  - The recommended length represents the size of the payload.
  - The recommended part represents a single part of a set of packets for when the data being transmitted is split across multiple payloads.
  - The recommended total represents the total number of parts representing a complete data transmitted across multiple payloads.
  - The recommended status represents status codes (such as success or failure) and multiple.
  - The Content for the recommended length and status are positive whole numbers (including zero) that may be in binary, octal, decimal, duodecimal, or hexidecimal numerical format.

  The payload\:
  - The payload's Content may contain anything, including raw binary data.
  - The payload is required to be the last list Object in the file.
  - The payload is recommended to have its size designated in some manner in the header (such as with the recommended length).
  - The payload is terminated by the EOF character or by the recommended length header.
  - The payload may be empty (length may be zero), but the list Object payload must still exist.
  - Nothing in the payload may be considered a valid list Object by the outer "FSS-0002 (Basic List)" and therefore escaping is unnecessary (No further processing by the outer "FSS-0002 (Basic List)" is allowed at this point).
  - Comments in the payload are not considered comments and are instead considered part of the payload, as-is.
  - Essentially, the payload should be treated as binary data embedded in a text file.

  The recommended length header Object used to designate the payload size does not necessarily have to be defined in the header.
  That is to say, if the payload is expected to be of some pre-defined or static length then a length does not need to be provided in the header.

  The recommended status header Object may be a string, such as "F_none", or a positive whole number.
  What the status code represents is application specific (or specific to a sub-standard) but may often be used to represent FLL status code.
  - The FLL status code is a 16-bit digit whose first two high-order bits represent error and warning ( representing signal).
  - The FLL status code as a number is binary sensitive and may not be portable across binaries or systems.
  - For best portability, consider using status as a name string to ensure cross-system or cross-binary compatibility.

  Example\:
    # fss-000e
    # valid comments are ignored.
    header\:
      type error
      status 296
      length 30

    payload\:
    The program is out of memory.

  Outer Objects would be\:
    1) header
    2) payload

  "header" Objects would be\:
    1.1) type
    1.2) status
    1.3) length

  "header" Contents would be\:
    1.1.1) error
    1.2.1) 296
    1.3.1) 30

  The payload would be\:
    2) The program is out of memory.
