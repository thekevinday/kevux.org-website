Featureless Settings Specification: 0009 - Reverse Mapping:
  This is based off of fss-0000 Basic, except the Object is at the end of the line.

  Each Object starts at the end of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as part of the object.
  Whitespace separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be preceded by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing whitespace precedes a valid Object, that Object is considered to have no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as a single Content column that begins at a newline.
  Content column consists of everything following the first non-whitespace character at the start of the line until the Object is reached.
  Content column includes trailing whitespace before newline is reached.
  Content column does not include any of the whitespace between the last non-whitespace character and the start of the Object.
  No delimits are supported in the Content.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \b = either whitespace or printable, except newline.
    \q = non-whitespace or quoted whitespace with no whitespace outside of the quotes.
    \n = newline.
    * = zero or more occurrences.
    + = one or more occurrences.

  Before Structure\:

  Structure\:
    \s*\b*\s+\q+\s*\n

  After Structure\:

  Example\:
    # fss-0009
    # valid comments are ignored.
    Content from newline. "The Object"
    object set. Second

  Object would be\:
    1) The Object
    2) Second

  Content would be\:
    1.1) Content from newline.
    2.1) object set.
