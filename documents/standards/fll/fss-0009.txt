Featureless Settings Specification: 0009 - Reverse Mapping:
  This is based off of "FSS-0000 (Basic)", except the Object is at the end of the line.

  Each Object starts at the end of a line and white space to the left of the Object is not treated as part of the object.
  White space separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be preceded by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing white spaces or non-printable characters precedes a valid Object, then that Object is considered to have no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as a single Content column that begins at a newline.
  Content column consists of everything following the first non-white space character at the start of the line until the Object is reached.
  Content column includes trailing white space before newline is reached.
  Content column does not include any of the white space between the last non-white space character and the start of the Object.
  No delimits are supported in the Content.

  Key\:
    "\s" = White space, except newline.
    "\b" = Either white space or printable, except newline.
    "\q" = Non-white space or quoted white space with no white space outside of the quotes.
    "\n" = Newline.
    "*" = Zero or more occurrences.
    "+" = One or more occurrences.

  Example\:
    # fss-0009
    # valid comments are ignored.
    Content from newline. "The Object"
    object set. Second

  Object would be\:
    1) The Object
    2) Second

  Content would be\:
    1.1) Content from newline.
    2.1) object set.
