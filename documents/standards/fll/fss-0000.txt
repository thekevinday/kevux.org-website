Featureless Settings Specification: 0000 - Basic:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as part of the object.
  Whitespace separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be preceded by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing whitespace follows a valid Object, that Object is considered to have no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as a single Content column terminated by a newline.
  Content column consists of everything following the first non-whitespace character until the newline.
  Content column includes trailing whitespace before newline is reached.
  Content column does not include any of the leading whitespace.
  No delimits are supported in the Content.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \b = either whitespace or printable, except newline.
    \q = non-whitespace or quoted whitespace with no whitespace outside of the quotes.
    \n = newline.
    * = zero or more occurrences.
    + = one or more occurrences.
