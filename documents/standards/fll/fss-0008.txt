      Third {
        Fourth {
          This is nested Content.
        }
      }

  Outer Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Inner Objects (depth 1) would be\:
    2.1) Third

  Inner Objects (depth 2) would be\:
    2.1.1) Fourth

  Inner Contents (depth 0) would be\:
    1.1.1) Does not need to be quoted.
           This: does not need to be delimited.
           }

    2.1.1) Nested Example.

           Third {
             Fourth {
               This is nested Content.
             }
           }

  Inner Contents (depth 1) would be\:
    2.1.1.1) Fourth {
               This is nested Content.
             }

  Inner Contents (depth 2) would be\:
