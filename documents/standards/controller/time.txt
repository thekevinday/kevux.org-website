Time Specification:
  There are two units of bold:"Time", the first is simply called bold:"Time" and the second is called bold:"EpochTime".

  Both bold:"Time" and bold:"EpochTime" are measured without the year but may contain a year to designate the point in the counting begins.
  These are both represented by a single 64-bit (unsigned) integer.
  The default timezone is always UTC:"Coordinated Universal Time".

  The common form is intended as the non-technical form that is form common use.
  This may have a negative value or be more than 64-bit digits long.
  This is simply not expected to be interpreted as a unit of time on a computer (but nothing stops it from being interpreted).

  The technical forms are limit to 64-bit unsigned for technical use but should technology advance to a point where larger bits are needed then this allows for that.
  The systems should expect 64-bit and larger bits would have to become common before something larger than 64-bit is the expected or assumed default.
  Negative signs can be allowed but they must not prevent the full use of the 64-bit.
  The implementation of how this is done is left to the implementer except that the signs are immediately to the left of the digit.
  For example code:"2022:-5" would be 5 units after the start of the year 2022.
  Because the negative is allowed, so must the positive character (such as code:"2022:+5").
  A positive value is the default interpretation when no sign is valid.

  The unit of time called bold:"Time" is counted increments of a nanosecond, or 10^-9 seconds.
  A unit of bold:"Time" is, therefore, equivalent to a nanosecond.
  The default year for bold:"Time" is the current year.

  The unit of time called bold:"EpochTime" is counted increments of a second, or 10^-9 seconds.
  A unit of bold:"EpochTime" is, therefore, equivalent to a second.
  The default year for bold:"EpochTime" is the bold:"UNIX Epoch", sometimes called bold:"Unix time".

  The unit bold:"Time" has two technical forms and one common form, with the year and without the year.
