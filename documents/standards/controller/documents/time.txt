Time Documentation:
  This documents a unit of measurement called a bold:"Time", represented with uppercase bold:"T".
  For comparison, a unit of bold:"Time" is equivalent to a nanosecond, or 10^-9 seconds.
  A bold:"MegaTime (MT)" is therefore equivalent to a millisecond such that a millisecond is 10^-3 seconds.

  A unit of bold:"Time" is intended to represent some unit of bold:"Time" such that a single 64-bit integer may hold all units of bold:"Time" for a single calendar year.
  This unit of bold:"Time" does not and must not include bold:"Years" (unlike bold:"Unix time").
  To convert from bold:"Time" to bold:"Unix time", one must have a year (which could be assumed to be the current year) and then calculate all of those calendar oddities.

  A unit of bold:"Time" by default is assumed to be in UTC:"Coordinated Universal Time".
    - code:"1 (Earth) year ~= 31536000000000000 Time or 31536000 GT (GigaTime)".
    - code:"1 (Earth) day = 86400000000000 Time or 86400 GT (GigaTime)".
    - code:"1 (Earth) hour = 3600000000000 Time or 3600 GT (GigaTime)".
    - code:"1 (Earth) minute = 60000000000 Time or 60 GT (GigaTime)".
    - code:"1 (Earth) second = 1000000000 Time or 1 GT (GigaTime)".

  Consequentially, 1 day is easily represented in units of bold:"Time" as code:"86.4 TT (TeraTime)".

  The Time may be stored in its "year string format".
  In this format, a Year may be prepended to the Time followed by a single colon ':' to associate a year with the Time.
  This Year has no minimum or maximum but may not have decimals.
  For example, "2020:86400000000000" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.
  For example, "2020:86.4 TT" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.

  A second unit of bold:"Time", called bold:"EpochTime", works the same way as bold:"Time" except it represents seconds.
  This unit is designated code:"ET".
  The format is similar to bold:"Time", except there are two colons: code:"1970::1620874738" would represent: code:"May 13, 2021 2:58:58 UTC".
  When the year is not specified, then this is identical to bold:"UNIX Epoch".

  A unit of bold:"EpochTime" by default is assumed to be in UTC:"Coordinated Universal Time".
    - code:"1 (Earth) year ~= 31536000 EpochTime or 31.536 GE (GigaEpochTime)".
    - code:"1 (Earth) day = 86400 EpochTime".
    - code:"1 (Earth) hour = 3600 EpochTime".
    - code:"1 (Earth) minute = 60 EpochTime".
    - code:"1 (Earth) second = 1 EpochTime".
    - code:"1 GT (GigaTime) = 1 EpochTime".

  Consequentially, 1 day is easily represented in units of bold:"EpochTime" as code:"86.4 KE (KiloEpochTime)".

  See the specification file:"time.txt" for more precise technical details.
