  The Rule files follow the FSS-000D (Basic Rule) format with IKI-0000 (Unrestricted).

  A Rule file name is expected to have the file extension ".rule".

  For each Rule file\:
    - The outer most part is a FSS-0002 (Basic List).
    - The Basic List Object is considered the "Rule Type".
    - The Basic List Content is determined by the specific "Rule Type".
    - The Content for each "Rule Type" is called the "Item".
    - Each Item Object is the "Item Name".
    - Each Item Content is either the "Action" or the "Setting".
    - Each Action Object is the "Action Name".
    - Each Action Content are the "Action Parameters".
    - Each Setting Object is the "Setting Name".
    - Each Setting Content are the "Setting Values".

    - "service": Follows either FSS-0003 (Extended List) or FSS-0001 (Extended).
    - "settings": Is required and follows either  FSS-0001 (Extended).
