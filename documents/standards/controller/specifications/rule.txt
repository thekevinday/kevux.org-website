Rule Specification:
  The Rule files follow the code:"FSS-000D (Basic Rule)" format with bold:"IKI-0000 (Unrestricted)".

  A Rule file name is expected to have the file extension code:".rule".

  For each Rule file\:
    - The outer most part is a code:"FSS-0002 (Basic List)".
    - The Basic List Object is considered the code:"Rule Type".
    - The Basic List Content is determined by the specific code:"Rule Type".
    - The Content for each code:"Rule Type" is called the code:"Item".
    - Each Item Object is the code:"Item Name".
    - Each Item Content is either the code:"Action" or the code:"Setting".
    - Each Action Object is the code:"Action Name".
    - Each Action Content are the code:"Action Parameters".
    - Each Setting Object is the code:"Setting Name".
    - Each Setting Content are the code:"Setting Values".

  The Rule Types\:
    - code:"command": Follows either code:"FSS-0003 (Extended List)" or code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".
    - code:"script": Follows either code:"FSS-0003 (Extended List)" or code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".
    - code:"service": Follows either code:"FSS-0003 (Extended List)" or code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".
    - code:"settings": Is required and follows either  code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".
    - code:"utility": Follows either code:"FSS-0003 (Extended List)" or code:"FSS-0001 (Extended)".

  For the above Rule Types, code:"settings" may be specified only once whereas the others may be specifed multiple times.
  The code:"settings" Rule Type is always processed first, regardless of position.
  The other Rule Types are processed top-down.
