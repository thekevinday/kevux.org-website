Exit Specification:
  The Exit files follow the FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List) format.

  An Exit file name is expected to have the file extension ".exit".

  For each Exit file\:
    - The outer most part is a FSS-0002 (Basic List).
    - The Basic List Object is considered the "Item".
    - The Basic List Content are considered the "Actions".
    - The "Actions" are FSS-0001 (Extended).
    - Each Action Object is the "Action Name".
    - Each Action Content are the "Action Parameters".
