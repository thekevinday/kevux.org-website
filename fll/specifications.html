                The Featureless Linux Library defines several standards for use in this project. Many of these standards are defined via the Featureless Settings Specifications. Most of these are focused on settings files (configuration files) but are written general enough to support a wide range of uses. The original project that the <abbr title="Featureless Linux Library">FLL</abbr> project is built around is the <em class="em">Featureless Make</em> program, also called <strong class="strong">Fake</strong>. The <strong class="strong">Fake</strong> program is a great example on how the <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr> are intended to be used.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The standards are not limited to those defined in the <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr>. There are the <em class="em">IKI</em> standards (which is not an acronym). The term <em class="em">IKI</em> plays off of the term <em class="em">Wiki</em>. The <em class="em">IKI</em> standard is intended to have simpler syntax than a <em class="em">Wiki</em> syntax and is used in several <abbr title="Featureless Linux Library">FLL</abbr> projects and even inside standards defined by <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr>.

                The Featureless Settings Specifications describe a set of standards designed around the age-old design principle referred to as <em class="em">Keep It Simple Stupid</em>, aka <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr> are primarily intended for settings files but are extensible enough to be used beyond that.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr> defines the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Will consist of numerous different kinds of specification files, depending on the type of information stored.</li>
                <li>As with the practice of "<code class="code">#!/bin/bash</code>", the setting files <em class="em">should</em> have the following: "<code class="code"># fss-????" format, such as "# FSS-0001</code>".</li>
                <li>Multiple sub-standards may be appended to the FSS header, using the same format structure, such as supporting IKI: "# FSS-0000 iki-0000" or HTML5: "# FSS-0000 html-0005".</li>
                <li>With the <code class="code">?</code> representing the (hexadecimal/base-16) number that represents the particular specification structure.</li>
                <li>All settings specifications <em class="em">should</em> avoid any form of noise, relative to the data being stored.</li>
                <li><abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> would be considered anti-<abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> due to the extreme level of noise generated by the <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> language (not easy to read).</li>
                <li>The settings files are setup so that they should (reasonably) produce easy readability on both the console and in a GUI.</li>
                <li>The specifications should strive for completeness (see the <a href="fll/specifications.html#completeness_theorem" class="link">Completeness Theorem</a>).</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="p">
                The most basic form of <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr> consists of two main parts: an <em class="em">Object</em> and the <em class="em">Content</em>.
              </p>
              <dl class="dl">
                <div class="di">
                  <dt class="dt"><strong class="strong">Object</strong></dt>
                  <dd class="dd">Considered the name or identifier of some property or data. Objects do not require an associated <em class="em">Content</em>.</dd>
                </div>
                <div class="di">
                  <dt class="dt"><strong class="strong">Content</strong></dt>
                  <dd class="dd">The data associated with a given Object; all Content <em class="em">must</em> have an associated <em class="em">Object</em>.</dd>
                </div>
              </dl>
              <p class="p">
                Objects and Contents can include any characters allowed by the specifications.
                The specification may choose how a given Object or Content are represented and parsed.
                For example, in <code class="code">FSS-0000 (Basic)</code>, Content is treated as a single item whereas in <code class="code">FSS-0001 (Extended)</code>, Content is broken apart in multiple sub-parts.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Contents may be broken up into zero or more discrete sets of Content.
                Each of these discrete sets of Content are referred to as a column.
                These columns do not need to be setup in a column structure, the word <em class="em">column</em> is simply used as a grouping terminology.
                While a Content refers to the entire set, a column (more specifically, a Content column) refers to the individual discrete sets within the Content.
                For example, in <code class="code">fss-000 (Basic)</code> the entire Content may be further represented as a single column.
                For example, in <code class="code">fss-001 (Extended)</code> the entire Content may be further represented as multiple columns.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                In all cases, specifications that separate Objects from Contents using white space, the first white space separating the Object and Content must not be considered part of the Object nor part of the Content.
                All spaces after the first separating white space is generally ignored until the first non white space character is found, unless otherwise specified.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, all specifications are newline sensitive (<code class="code">\n</code> only).
                Newline characters are only <code class="code">\n</code> and are never anything else (<code class="code">\r</code> is not considered newline in any manner).
                These specifications refer to characters that have printable representation as <em class="em">printable</em>.
                These specifications refer to characters that have no printable representation as <em class="em">non-printable</em>.

                White spaces characters that are printable, such as tabs and spaces, must be considered the same type for the purposes of parsing.
                Non-printing white spaces characters (zero-width characters) are ignored, are treated as placeholders for processing with the exception of combining characters.
                White spaces that use combining characters result in printable characters and the resulting combination is treated as not white space.
                Zero-width characters that use combining characters are treated as non-printing characters and are skipped.
                In terms of processing, it is recommended that the <code class="code">NULL</code> character is not considered the end of a string, but this is only a suggestion.
                Any specification may chose to limit, restrict, or otherwise prohibit special Unicode characters such as combining characters or zero-width characters.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, newlines designate the potential start (or end) of an Object or Content.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, white space may exist to the left of the start of Objects.
                Unless otherwise specified, white space may exist to the right of the end of Objects, but only if that given Object is properly quoted and the white space is after the terminating quote but before any Content.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, white space immediately both before (and after, outside of the terminating quote) an Object is not considered part of the Object.
                This simplifies identifying the object, use quoted Objects to support white space before/after an object for styling purposes.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, quotes may only be either a single quote <code class="code">'</code> or a double quote <code class="code">"</code> and only a backslash <code class="code">\</code> may be used as a delimiter.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                For example, <code class="code">FSS-0000 (Basic)</code>:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><code class="code">\"Object 1"</code> has content starting at the <code class="code">1</code>, with an Object named <code class="code">"Object</code>.</li>
                <li><code class="code">\\"Object 1"</code> has content starting at the <code class="code">1</code>, with an Object named <code class="code">\"Object</code>.</li>
                <li><code class="code">"Object 1\"</code> is an unterminated object due to the escaped closing quote.</li>
                <li><code class="code">"Object 1\\"</code> has content starting at the <code class="code">has</code>, with an Object named <code class="code">"Object 1\"</code>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="p">
                Unless otherwise specified, character/data delimits are performed only when required and not unilaterally.
                In the case of Objects, delimits would only apply when that Object could be potentially identified as an Object.
                For example, <code class="code">FSS-0001 (Extended)</code> needs quotes to group parts that include spaces, if there is no initial quote, then a quote following the data <em class="em">must not</em> be delimited.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Such as these following three lines:
              </p><pre class="preserve">
"Object 1" "This is a single quoted Content." \"Additional unquoted Content."
Object_2 This is multiple" Contents and the trailing quote does not need to be delimited.
"Object \"3" 'Wouldn't require delimits if no white space or end of string after.'
</pre>
              <p class="p">
                Unlike this specification, a more traditional delimit process would have the above three lines instead represented as:
              </p><pre class="preserve">
"Object 1" "This is a single quoted Content." \"Additional unquoted Content.\"
Object_2 This is multiple\" Contents and the trailing quote does not need to be delimited.
"Object \\"3" 'Wouldn\'t require delimits if no white space or end of string after.'
</pre>
              <p class="p">
                These examples would resolve as follows:
              </p><pre class="preserve">
1) Object\:
  - Object 1
   Content\:
  - This is a single quoted Content.
  - "Additional
  - unquoted
  - Content"
2) Object\:
  - Object_2
   Content\:
  - This
  - is
  - multiple"
  - Contents
  - and
  - the
  - trailing
  - quote
  - does
  - not
  - need
  - to
  - be
  - delimited.
3) Object\:
  - Object \"3
   Content\:
  - Wouldn't require delimits if no white space or end of string after.
</pre>
              <p class="p">
                All specifications are expected to support or be of the character encoding <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit">UTF-8</abbr>; however, there is no imposed restriction on supporting or using any other encoding.
                Those encodings must only support the appropriate characters required by a given standard for differentiating Objects, Contents, and delimits.
                All specifications do assume <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> and Unicode support.

                Unless otherwise specified, comments are designated by the pound symbol <code class="code">#</code> but only if only white space is to the left of the pound or the pound <code class="code">#</code> is at the start of the line.
                There is no support for inline comments.
                Unless otherwise specified, the start comment may be delimited by <code class="code">" in the same manner as Objects and Contents are.
                This delimit only applies to the start of a comment (the pound code:</code>#" character) as there is no terminating character for a comment (other than a newline <code class="code">\n</code>).
                A line containing a valid comment is in its entirety ignored.
                This means that if there is white space before the designation symbol (the pound <code class="code">#</code> character) then that white space is ignored.

                This keeps the processing and logic simple and safe, for both <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit">UTF-8</abbr> and <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>.
                White space used for designation characters <em class="em">must</em> include support for <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit">UTF-8</abbr> white space characters, unless otherwise specified.
                However, these white space used as a designation character, must be printing white space that are not combining white space characters.
                Any visible/graph character that is considered a white space (such as <code class="code">U+1680</code> <code class="code"> </code>) is not to be considered a white space, unless otherwise specified.

                When used for syntax matching purposes, zero-width Unicode characters are only to be considered zero-width unless otherwise specified.

                In any specification where security is intended, if there exists a Unicode character that matches an <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> character, that Unicode character <em class="em">may</em> be prohibited by that standard in favor of the <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> equivalent.
                One such example is in the case of a <abbr title="Byte Order Mark">URL</abbr>, where the name could be used to trick a person (<code class="code">http://this-site.com/</code> vs <code class="code">http://this‐site.com/</code>).
                This (potential insecure behavior) is allowed in general because a well written program would be able to detect and communicate the possible misunderstanding and thereby avoid mistakes without imposing any character restrictions.

              <p class="p">
                This is a common behavior for security reasons, each character used for any special purposes must be visibly distinct, with white space and non-printing characters as the exception to the words <em class="em">visibly distinct</em>.

              <p class="p">
                The IKI syntax provides a vocabulary name (with specific context associated with it) followed by quoted code that is associated with the given vocabulary name.
                The vocabulary represents a list of allowed variable names that may also have specific contextual meaning defined by a given IKI specification.
                The variable name is considered the <em class="em">Object</em>.
                The variable value is considered the <em class="em">Content</em>.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The IKI format will use <code class="code">iki-0000</code> to represent an IKI with no explicitly defined vocabulary.
                Whereas <code class="code">iki-0001</code> and beyond represent a specific IKI vocabulary.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                A potential IKI variable name starts on word (or <code class="code">_</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, <code class="code">+</code>) characters.
                White space and non-word (and non <code class="code">_</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, <code class="code">+</code>) character punctuations may not exist as part of the variable name.
                The only Unicode dash-like characters allowed as a "dash" are those intended to connect, such as the Unicode hyphens (<code class="code">U+2010</code> and <code class="code">U+2011</code>).

              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Unicode punctuation connector characters are supported just like <code class="code">_</code>, except when they connect outside the current line (such as <code class="code">U+FE33</code> <code class="code">︳</code>).
                Unicode invisible punctuations (such as invisible plus: <code class="code">U+2064</code>) are not considered a punctuations in this standard (because they a zero-width characters), therefore they are not to be considered a valid <code class="code">_</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, or <code class="code">+</code> Unicode equivalents.

Other times I want to render a url such as this example url: url:'http://www.example.com/url with space/'.

There are no comments, except for maybe the FSS header (which would not resolve to any IKI syntax anyway).

Quotes may be included, such as: code:"const char *string = \"My \\\"quoted\\\" C string.\";".

              <p class="p">
                The <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong> represents an informal theory by Kevin Day focusing on how software should be complete. The theory has not been formalized and the following is a basic explanation. A formal definition may be provided in the future.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                When developing software, one should not program for the minimum requirements. Instead, one should consider the scope of the project and its intended design. Taking that into consideration all functionality needed to achieve this should be considered and implemented.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The most common misconceptions about this theorem is that it is not about writing all possible combinations, permutations, possibilities, etc. In fact, it is more accurate to say the opposite. The key focus is figuring out what the scope and intended functionalities are and make sure to achieve those.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                This does not conflict with <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> but instead complements it.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                If this is not clear, then consider thinking of things this way. The <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> focuses on keeping the design and process simple. The <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong> focuses on making sure the design is complete.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Now if, say a car, is designed to follow <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> but violates the <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong>, then that car could be built without doors. Not having doors simplifies the car. It is much simpler and easier to get in and out of.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                Using that example, a car designed to follow both <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> and the <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong> would have doors.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                To better understand the <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong>, again take the car example. If the car is intended to be used only in say photo shoots and is not in any way intended ever to be used, then as per the <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong>, the car would not need an engine. Whereas a car designed and intended to be used that does not have an engine would fail to follow the <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong>.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong> is subjective and is intended to be used as a guide.
              </p>
              <p class="p">
                The <strong class="strong">Completeness Theorem</strong> asserts that perfection is impossible and pointless and one must instead understand what is necessary to complete the project rather than to handle all possibilities. Simply because perfection isn't possible doesn't mean one must lower their standards or have no standards. Determine what is or is not needed to complete the project and meet that rather than meet less than that.

                  <dd class="dd">A <em class="em">Web Service Interface</em> is a new term created so that this project can more appropriately communicate the concept of a web service. A <em class="em">Web Service Interface</em> describes the interface in which to communicate to and receive response from a web service and is described by or adheres to some web protocol.</dd>

                Based on this terminology, a standard is the representation of some set of rules and guidelines, however it is the specification that actually defines and describes those roles. The last '<em class="em">S</em>' in <abbr title="Featureless Settings Specifications">FSS</abbr> can therefore be used to represent either "standard" or "specification" in casual speech. Given that an implementation is not a standard, an implementation can deviate from the standard (or the specification of some standard). Such deviations do not alter the standard nor do they alter the specification.

                Good documentation practices suggest the documentation of an implementation. It is very easy to confuse the specification of an implementation of some standard with the specification of the standard itself. This has happened several times in history where some implementation violates the standard but despite being non-standard that implementation becomes popular. When the specification of that, now non-standard, implementation becomes popularized, those properly following the specification of the standard tend to suffer.

                This project encourages deviations from the standards and such actions are allowed and protected by the copyright licenses. However, this project discourages communicating compliance of some standard when something is, in fact, not compliant. Problems in the interpretation of a standard fall under communication problems and are not considered deviations from the standard even though it may technically be a deviation. It is for these reasons that the terminology has been explicitly defined, clarified, and presented on this page.
