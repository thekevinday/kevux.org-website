              <p>
                <span class="bold error"><i>WARNING: Partitioning a system can be dangerous, do not perform these operations on a system with important information on it.<br>
                Get practice on a harddrive that you can afford to have it's data lost before doing this on a working system.</i></span><br>
                <br>
                Due to the complexity and risks of partitioning, this tutorial is mostly going to assume you have an entire harddrive to be formatted.<br>
                The partitioner tool can be found on the effective <i>"Start Menu"</i> under <span class="notice">Utilities -> Disk Partitioner</span>.<br>
                <span class="bold important">NOTE: For the more experienced users, fdisk and pdisk both exist on the system as well as the mke2fs and similar utilities.</span><br>

              <p>
                The first thing you will have to figure out is which harddrive (if you have more than one) are you using.<br>
                If you cannot figure out what harddrive to use, then <span class="bold error">do not continue</span> until you have properly identified your correct harddrive.<br>
                On the top-right of the partitioner, there is a drop down box that has something like <span class="notice">/dev/sda</span>.<br>
                This drop-down box is used to select the correct harddrive.<br>
              </p>
              <a href="distributions/turtle/documentation/images/HowTo_Partition-3.png"><img src="distributions/turtle/documentation/images_small/HowTo_Partition-3.png" alt="Screenshot of how to partition step 3." align="top" border="0"></a><br>
              <p>
                There are some important names and rules that must be learned at this point.<br>
                Harddrives can be broken down into pieces that are called partitions.<br>
                Harddrives can be broken down into <span class="notice">at most 4 partitions</span>.<br>
                To increase the number of available partitions, an <span class="notice">extended partition</span> must be created.<br>
                <span class="notice">Extended partitions</span> should be avoided unless you need them and then you usually want to place them as the last partition (sda4, for example).<br>
                <br>
                Now that you have the partitions taken care of, lets focus on the <span class="notice">filesystems</span>.<br>
                The <span class="notice">filesystems</span> are pretty technical and specify how the data is stored and retrieved.<br>
                What you need to worry about is what <span class="notice">Operating System</span> uses which partitions.<br>
                <br>
                In general, the <span class="notice">ntfs</span> filesystem is used by the Microsoft Windows Operating System.<br>
                Standard usb memory sticks generally use the <span class="notice">vfat</span> filesystem, which is used by old Microsoft Windows Operating Systems (Windows 98 and older).<br>
                Linux Operating Systems (like Kevux) use the <span class="notice">ext3</span>, <span class="notice">ext2</span>, and <span class="notice">linux swap</span> filesystems.<br>
                If general, you want to use <span class="notice">ext3</span> for linux because it can handle large filesystems quickly.<br>
                If you have a usb memory stick to run Kevux off of, then use <span class="notice">ext2</span> to increase the potential lifetime of the stick (for highly technical reasons).<br>
                The <span class="notice">linux swap</span> filesystem is used to help extend memory, but because you are using a Kevux system, yuu will probably not need any swap.<br>
                Of course, if you have an old system, say 128 or less MB of ram, then feel free to create a <span class="notice">linux swap</span> filesystem of perhaps 512MB.<br>
                <br>
                The grey space that has <span class="notice">unallocated</span> means that a partition is not created for that particular area.<br>
                What this means is that the <span class="notice">unallocated</span> area will not be available for use.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold error">Don't use NTFS for any linux system.</span><br>
              </p>
            <a href="distributions/turtle/documentation/images/HowTo_Partition-4.png"><img src="distributions/turtle/documentation/images_small/HowTo_Partition-4.png" alt="Screenshot of how to partition step 4." align="top" border="0"></a><br>
              <p>
                Again, this example is assuming that you are going to use the entire harddrive.<br>
                Make sure to delete any existing partitions by selecting each individual partition and deleting that partition (<span class="notice">partition -> delete</span>).<br>
                Once everything is deleted, you should only see a single massive unallocated area.<br>
              </p>
            <a href="distributions/turtle/documentation/images/HowTo_Partition-5.png"><img src="distributions/turtle/documentation/images_small/HowTo_Partition-5.png" alt="Screenshot of how to partition step 5." align="top" border="0"></a><br>
              <p>
                Now you should be ready to create partitions.<br>
                First you should create the <span class="notice">boot partition</span>.<br>
                The <span class="notice">boot partition</span> should be of one of the following sizes: 16MB, 32MB, 64MB, 128MB, or 256MB.<br>
                The latter is beyond more than enough space.<br>
                The filesystem should be <span class="notice">ext2</span> but can safely be <span class="notice">ext3</span>.<br>
                <br>
                Next you need to create the <span class="notice">root partition</span>.<br>
                The <span class="notice">root partition</span> should be of one of the following size: 2048MB, 4096MB, 8192MB, 16384MB, 32768MB, 65536MB.<br>
                The latter is more than enough space, in fact, it is 64 Gigabytes.<br>
                <br>
                Now all the remaining space will be your <span class="notice">home partition</span>.<br>
                Just fill up every last bit available.<br>
              </p>
            </div>

              <header class="section-header header">
                <h2 class="h h2">Mounting the CD-Rom</h2>
              </header>
              <a href="distributions/turtle/documentation/images/Mounting_Cdrom.png"><img src="distributions/turtle/documentation/images_small/Mounting_Cdrom.png" alt="Screenshot of mounting CD-ROM." align="top" border="0"></a><br>
              <p>
                Okay, so you need to mount (use) the cdrom.<br>
                If you have only 1 cdrom drive, then you can simply type in console: <span class="notice">mount /mnt/cdrom/01</span><br>
                If you have more than one, then you can try mounting them until you get the correct one.<br>
                In such a case, the next command following above might be <span class="notice">mount /mnt/cdrom/02</span><br>
                Of course, you can almost guarantee getting the correct cdrom with the following command: <span class="notice">mount LABEL=Turtle-0.8.8-live /mnt/cdrom</span>, where 0.8.0 is the version of Turtle Kevux that you are mounting.<br>
                <br>
                Once the cdrom is mounted, you can access the contents at the location it was mounted on.<br>
                This means that if you ran the command: <span class="notice">mount /mnt/cdrom/03</span>, then you will find the cdrom contents in the directory <span class="notice">/mnt/cdrom/03</span>.<br>
                Another example is if you mounted the cdrom with <span class="notice">mount LABEL=Turtle-0.8.8-live /mnt/cdrom</span>, then you will find the contents of the cdrom in the directory <span class="notice">/mnt/cdrom</span><br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <hr>

              <p>
                This will be assuming that you correctly created the partitions and mounted the cdrom based on the tutorials above.<br>
                Let us pretend that we only have one harddrive and therefore it's device name will be called <span class="notice">/dev/sda</span>.<br>
                This means we have 3 partitions, a <span class="notice">boot partition</span> at <span class="notice">/dev/sda1</span>, a <span class="notice">root partition</span> at <span class="notice">/dev/sda2</span>, and a <span class="notice">home partition</span> at /dev/sda3.<br>
                The order in which these are mounted <span class="notice">DOES</span> matter.<br>
                <br>
                Now, we need to mount the <span class="notice">root partition</span> first.<br>
                This is done with the command: <span class="notice">mount /mnt/sda/02</span><br>
                Once this is mounted, we need to create the directories that our other two directories will be mounted.<br>
                This is done with the command: <span class="notice">mkdir /mnt/sda/02/{boot,home}</span><br>
                <br>
                Now, we need to mount the <span class="notice">boot partition</span>.<br>
                This is done with the command: <span class="notice">mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda/02/boot</span><br>
                This command will explicitly mount the /dev/sda1 partition to the location /mnt/sda/02/boot.<br>
                <br>
                Now, we need to mount the <span class="notice">home partition</span>.<br>
                This is done with the command: <span class="notice">mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda/02/home</span><br>
                This command will explicitly mount the /dev/sda3 partition to the location /mnt/sda/02/home.<br>
                <br>
                You should now be ready to extract the system.<br>

              <p>
                Let us assume that you mounted the cdrom on <span class="notice">/mnt/cdrom/</span>.<br>
                If you have need to know how to do this, read the <a href="#mountingthecdrom">Mounting the CD-Rom</a>.<br>
                <br>
                Let us assume that you partitioned the harddrive as explained in <a href="#partitioningthesystem">Partitioning the System</a> and have mounted the partitions as explained in <a href="#mountingthepartition">Mounting the Partition</a> at the location <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02</span>.<br>
                <br>
                There is a program designed to ease the process of the installer and set all permissions correctly.<br>
                Do not install <span class="notice">without</span> this tool unless you know what you are doing.<br>
                The program is called: <span class="notice">extract_system</span>.<br>
                <br>
                Change to the extraction point: <span class="notice">cd /mnt/sda/02/</span><br>
                Run the extraction program, specifying the mounted cdrom as the source location: <span class="notice">extract_system -s /mnt/cdrom/</span><br>
                Wait for the program to finish.<br>
                You are now done extracting the system, the system is now effectively installed.<br>
                The next step is to configure the system so that it may boot.<br>

              <p>
                This is the very last step, aside from physically rebooting your computer.<br>
                Therefore, you better have read and gone through every other portion of the page.<br>
                This will be assuming that the system is properly extracted and mounted at: <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/</span>.<br>
                This will be assuming that you have 3 partitions, a <span class="notice">boot</span>, a <span class="notice">root</span>, and a <span class="notice">home</span>.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold important">NOTE: If at any point during this you need to know what harddrive is what and has what partitions, the command <span class="notice">fdisk -l</span> should be used.<br>
                You should use the output from <span class="notice">fdisk -l</span> to properly configure the <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file.</span><br>
                <br>
                Okay, there are two ways to boot your Turtle Kevux System, <span class="notice">dynamically</span> or <span class="notice">statically</span>.<br>
                The <span class="notice">static method</span> is less adaptable and slightly more technical given that you have to specify the exact partition locations.<br>
                The <span class="notice">dynamic method</span> is more adaptable but can under certain cases boot/mount the wrong partitions.<br>
                The <span class="notice">dynamic method</span> is the preferred method because it can cope better with hardware changes.<br>

                <span class="bold">Static Method</span><br>
                Edit the file <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> on your new system, which is located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span><br>
                Now look for the line that reads: <span class="notice"># Turtle-Kevux Basic Layout (Static)</span>.<br>
                Below this are commented out commands, and a comment is any line that starts with the pound <span class="notice">#</span> symbol.<br>
                There are two lines to pay attention to, the ones that begin with <span class="notice">#/dev/sda1</span> and <span class="notice">#/dev/sda3</span>.<br>
                Uncomment these lines by deleting the leading pound <span class="notice">#</span> symbol.<br>
                These are already pre-configured to work as is based on this documentation.<br>

                <br>
                The next step is to edit the <span class="notice">boot/grub/menu.lst</span> file currently located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/boot/grub/menu.lst</span><br>
                There are a lot of notes in this file, so you will need to search for the following lines:<br>
                - The line: <span class="notice">splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/turtle_grub.xpm.gz</span><br>
                - The line: <span class="notice">title Boot System</span><br>
                <br>
                The first thing to pay attention to are the lines with <span class="notice">(hd0,0)</span>.<br>
                If you followed the instructions in this documentation, then you will not have to pay attention to these.<br>
                However, the importance of these lines deem it necessary to at least make you take not of them for future reference.<br>
                Now that that is out of the way, the only line you should have to pay attention is the second line below <span class="notice">title Boot System</span>.<br>
                It is the line that begins with <span class="notice">kernel</span><br>
                <br>
                On this line, you need to scroll down that entire <span class="bold">long</span> line and change <span class="notice">finalroot=LABEL=turtle_/</span> to <span class="notice">/dev/sda2</span><br>
                Notice how this information directly relates to what you did with the <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file that is currently located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span><br>
                <br>
                You are now done with the static configuration, skip below to the <span class="bold">grub/mbr installation</span> below.<br>

                <span class="bold">Dynamic Method</span><br>
                Edit the file <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> on your new system, which is located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span><br>
                Now at the very top of the file you should see: <span class="notice"># Turtle-Kevux Embedded Layout (Dynamic)</span><br>
                There are two lines to pay attention to, the ones that begin with: <span class="notice">#LABEL=turtle_/boot</span> and <span class="notice">#LABEL=turtle_/home</span><br>
                Uncomment these lines by deleting the leading pound <span class="notice">#</span> symbol.<br>
                Notice that each of these lines start with <span class="notice">LABEL=</span>, this means that you are using the devices based on a name that you give them.<br>
                These devices currently do not have names, so we need to create them.<br>
                The names <span class="notice">MUST</span> be identical to the names define in the <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span>.<br>
                <br>
                To create the name for the first one, the <span class="notice">boot partition</span> which is currently the partition defined at <span class="notice">/dev/sda1</span>, you need to type the following: <span class="notice">e2label /dev/sda1 turtle_/boot</span><br>
                Notice that there is no <span class="notice">LABEL=</span> preceding the <span class="notice">turtle_/boot</span>.<br>
                If you were to execute the command <span class="notice">e2label /dev/sda1 LABEL=turtle_/boot</span>, then your <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file would have to have the line: <span class="notice">LABEL=LABEL=turtle_/boot</span>.<br>
                Repeat the process, this time for the <span class="notice">root partition</span> currently located at <span class="notice">/dev/sda2</span>: <span class="notice">e2label /dev/sda2 turtle_/</span><br>
                repeat the process, this time for the <span class="notice">home partition</span> currently located at <span class="notice">/dev/sda3</span>: e2label /dev/sda3 turtle_/home</span><br>
                If you change the names of these partitions to something else, make sure to reflect the changes in the <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file which is currently located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span>.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold error">WARNING: The command e2label will not work if you did not format the partitions with the ext2 or ext3 filesystems.</span><br>
                <span class="bold error">WARNING: Because the dynamic method mounts based on names, if two partitions have the same name, then something will most likely go wrong.<br>
                This is one of the few problems with the dynamic method.</span><br>

                On this line, you need to scroll down that entire <span class="bold">long</span> line and look at the part that has <span class="notice">finalroot=LABEL=turtle_/</span>.<br>
                Notice how this information directly relates to what you did with the <span class="notice">etc/fstab</span> file that is currently located at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/etc/fstab</span><br>
                This is the line that tells the boot process which partition is the <span class="notice">root partition</span>.<br>
                Because the file is pre-configured to use the <span class="notice">dynamic method</span> you will not have to change this unless you gave the <span class="notice">root partition</span> a name different from <span class="notice">turtle_/</span>.<br>

                <br>
                <span class="bold">grub/mbr installation</span><br>
                The grub file was configured, but it was not installed into what is called the <span class="notice">mbr</span> (master boot record).<br>
                This <span class="notice">mbr</span> tells the system how to boot.<br>
                Therefore it needs to be installed.<br>
                <br>
                The first step is to start the program by running: <span class="notice">grub</span>.<br>
                Now, remember those <span class="notice">(hd0,0)</span> lines from the <span class="notice">boot/grub/menu.lst</span> file currently location at <span class="notice">/mnt/sda/02/boot/grub/menu.lst</span>?<br>
                Well, now you have to type the following: <span class="notice">root (hd0,0)</span><br>
                Don't forget to press the enter key.<br>
                That line tells the <span class="notice">grub</span> program that you will install to the first harddrive <i>(the 0 to the left of the comma)</i> and to look for the <span class="notice">boot/grub/menu.lst</span> file on the first partition <i>(the 0 to the right of the comma)</i> of that harddrive.<br>
                The next command installs the <span class="notice">grub</span> program to the <span class="notice">mbr</span>.<br>
                The command to install <span class="notice">grub</span> is: <span class="notice">root (hd0)</span><br>
                This will install <span class="notice">grub</span> to the <span class="notice">mbr</span> of the first harddrive.<br>
                Now exit the program <i>(assuming everything worked)</i> with the quit command:<span class="notice">quit</span>.<br>
                <br>
                You should now be completely finished the installation process and can reboot your machine.<br>
                an easy way to do this is type the command: <span class="notice">reboot</span> or press the <span class="notice">Control + Alt + Delete</span> key sequence.<br>
