              <p>
                This tutorial is assuming that you have either a live-usb or a live-cdrom.<br>
                In order to boot the Live system you need to have your computer boot the device by rebooting the computer.<br>
                While booting your machine, you may have to press a key to select <span class="bold">boot options</span> or something of similar meaning.<br>
                Note: live-usb's cannot be directly booted to on most machines that only support usb 1.1 or less.<br>
                <i>To boot a live-usb on a usb 1.1 system, you will need a live cdrom that contains the appropriate grub.</i><br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold">Available Boot Options:</span><br>
                <code><span class="notice">
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Kevux System<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot Live System - Run From Memory<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot Live System - Run From CD-Rom<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance Mode<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check Memory<br>
                </span></code>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="bold notice">Install Kevux System:</span><br>
                  This boots to a live install system that runs either from memory or from the cdrom.<br>
                  The installation system is called KiWI and includes documentation on how to install the system.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold notice">Boot Live System - Run From Memory:</span><br>
                  This is the default boot option.<br>
                  This boot process will copy the compressed system into ram and run itself from ram.<br>
                  This boot process requires 384MB to 512MB of System Ram for the "everything" build.<br>
                  To calculate how much memory your particular build will require add the files sizes of the following files:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>bin.sfs</li>
                    <li>lib.sfs</li>
                    <li>sbin.sfs</li>
                    <li>share.sfs</li>
                    <li>home.sfs</li>
                    <li>etc.sfs</li>
                  </ul>
                  Once these file sizes are added up, add 70MB (for approximate runtime memory usage) to the results.<br>
                  Round the results to the nearest memory size; usually one of the following: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 2048<br>
                  This boot option will take some amount of time, ~20 seconds, to copy itself into memory.<br>
                  Once the system is booted, the cdrom or usb may be removed without causing any problems.<br>
                  Once the system is booted, most/all programs start instantly or within the first 1 to 6 seconds of waiting.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold notice">Boot Live System - Run From CD-Rom:</span><br>
                  This is the least flexible boot option.<br>
                  This will not copy itself into memory, saving boot time by not having to copy itself into memory.<br>
                  The downside is that much more time is lost because the system has to read the device every single time something is needed, slowing the execution process significantly.<br>
                  This boot process requires 64MB to 128MB or System Ram for the "everything" build.<br>
                  Once the system is booted, the cdrom or usb <span style="bold error">must NOT be removed</span> or problems will occur.<br>
                  Once the system is booted, most programs will start within the 5 to 30 seconds.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold notice">Maintenance Mode:</span><br>
                  This will immediately drop to the initrd bash environment.<br>
                  This allows you to manually and safely run fsck or similar commands for a particular system.<br>
                  When any of the boot options above fail, you will always be dropped into this mode.<br>
                  This is especially useful when the rootfs doesn't exist, the kernel will not lockup and you can still hit control+alt+delete<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold notice">Check Memory:</span><br>
                  This will start a dedicated memory tester.<br>
                  Run this for a few hours to give a decently thorough memory check.<br>
                  Reboot the machine to get out of this mode.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <span class="bold">Advanced Kevux-Specific Boot Options</span><br>
              <ul>
                <li id="boot_option_finalroot"><span class="bold notice">finalroot=</span><br>
                  Specifies the what root device partition is to be used before starting the system.<br>
                  Unlike the standard root=, finalroot= allows for any device naming system that the mount command can use.<br>
                  The primary use of finalroot= is to boot to a device by name and not by the device's physical number.<br>
                  This is especially useful for livecd's, liveusb's, and other dynamic systems.<br>
                  Do not use root= to boot a root filesystem, if you are using a kevux initrd.<br>
                  The root= option tells the kernel to load the initrd as the first rootfs.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_finalinit"><span class="bold notice">finalinit=</span><br>
                  Specifies what the init program is to be called after switching to the finalroot.<br>
                  Do not use init= to specify the init program, if you are using a kevux initrd.<br>
                  The init= option tells the kernel to load the initrd specific init program.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_subroot"><span class="bold notice">subroot=</span><br>
                  Allows one to load a rootfs from a specific folder inside of the finalroot device.<br>
                  This should allow one to have multiple rootfs's on a single partition.<br>
                  This can be useful for having different versions of the same system on a single partition without having any conflicts.<br>
                  Because the system will be running from withing the subroot, the final system will not be able to directly see any of the other subroots or the / of the actual partition.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_maintenance"><span class="bold notice">maintenance</span><br>
                  This tells the initrd to immediately drop to the initrd's /bin/bash.<br>
                  This normally loads the maintenance initrd.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_settings"><span class="bold notice">settings=</span><br>
                  This specifies a device that contains additional settings information in the same way finalroot= specifies a device.<br>
                  The additional settings information currently only supports encrypted boot settings.<br>
                  In the future, this is expected to be expanded and will also be used to perform network booting.<br>
                  All settings data is expected to be stored in the /boot/settings/ directory within the settings device.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_settingsname"><span class="bold notice">settingsname=</span><br>
                  The settings name represent a sub-directory within the /boot/settings/ directory.<br>
                  This allows for having multiple different settings data on a single settings device without conflicts.<br>
                  For example, lets say you have two sub-directories called: encrypted and network.<br>
                  By specifying the settingsname=network would mean that the network boot settings would be processed.<br>
                  By specifying the settingsname=encrypted would mean that the encrypted boot settings would be processed.<br>
                  If not settings name is passed, then the default is to use the files found within the /boot/settings/ directory and not some sub-directory.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_settingscdromsearch"><span class="bold notice">settingscdromsearch=</span><br>
                  This is identical to the cdromsearch= option explained below but only for finding the settings device.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_settingsmmcsearch"><span class="bold notice">settingsmmcsearch=</span><br>
                  This is identical to the mmcsearch= option explained below but only for finding the settings device.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_runlevel"><span class="bold notice">runlevel=</span><br>
                  Use this to execute a specific set of init instructions during system boot.<br>
                  These instructions are defined in <span class="notice">/etc/initng/runlevel/</span>.<br>
                  The default runlevel is called: <span class="notice">/etc/initng/runlevel/default.runlevel</span>.<br>
                  The KiWI installer uses the runlevel called: <span class="notice">/etc/initng/runlevel/kiwi.runlevel</span>.<br>
                  <br>
                  Example:<br>
                  If you wish to boot to a runlevel called single (<span class="notice">/etc/initng/runlevel/single.runlevel</span>), you would use the boot command: <span class="notice">runlevel=single</span>.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li id="boot_option_squashboot"><span class="bold notice">squashboot=</span><br>
                  This tells the initrd to execute the live_init script using the squash compressed files.<br>
                  When this is specified, the finalroot= option is expected to be the partition, cdrom, or some device where the squash files are located.<br>
                  The squash files are expected to be in the directory <i>/boot/live/</i> of the finalroot device.<br>
                  There are the following parameters available:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="notice">device</span> - this means run the squash files directly from the finalroot device</li>
                    <li><span class="notice">memory</span> - this means copy the squash files into memory and run from memory</li>
                    <li><span class="notice">extract</span> - this means extract the squash files into memory and run from memory</li>
                  </ul>
                  The live_init defines an entirely new set of options explicitly useful for booting a livecdrom, a liveusb, or any system compressed into squash files<br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="bold">Squash Specific Boot Options</span><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li id="boot_option_squashpath"><span class="bold notice">squashpath=</span><br>
                      Specify a subdirectory or path on the finalroot= device that contains the squash files.<br>
                      This applies to both squashboot and squishboot boot modes.<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li id="boot_option_filesystemlimit"><span class="bold notice">filesystemlimit=</span><br>
                      Specify a hard limit on how large the memory filesystem will be.<br>
                      By default, no limit is set.<br>
                      The <i>Boot Live System - Run From Memory (uncompressed)</i> boot option does set a size limit that is over a 1GB<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li id="boot_option_etcdevice"><span class="bold notice">etcdevice=</span><br>
                      Specify the physical partition that contains the etc directory.<br>
                      This will be mounted to the /etc directory of the finalroot system.<br>
                      For using an ecrypted partition, this should be set to something like: <code>etcdevice=/dev/mapper/etc</code><br>
                      <br>
                    </li>

                      Specify the physical partition that contains the home directory.<br>
                      This will be mounted to the /home directory of the finalroot system.<br>

                  This is a hybrid between booting with squashboot and normal boot.<br>
                  Instead of running the entire system from squash files, only the primary binaries /bin, /sbin, /lib, and /toolchain are mounted via squash.<br>
                  Everything else is expected to be on the final root fs, already extracted.<br>
                  This allows for having compressed binaries on a small device while maintaining normal write behavior for most things.<br>
                  This method requires much less ram than squashboot.<br>
                  The squash files are expected to be in /live/boot/ of the final root system by default.<br>
                  Most of the additionaly squashboot options are supported and are renamed from squash to squish accordingly.<br>
                  For parameter conflict resolution, squishboot will override squashboot.<br>
                  This is particularly useful for embedded devices and the OLPC-XO.<br>

                When all things work correctly, you should end up sitting on an XFCE desktop screen with a backgroup picture of a stream in a forest.<br>
                This is the default desktop environment and the default layout.<br>
                Enjoy.<br>
                <br>

              <p>
                Unfortunately, not all things work all of the time.<br>
                Whenever something goes wrong with the boot process, you will get stuck with a login prompt.<br>
                In order to Login, see <a href="#loggingin">Logging In Below</a>.<br>
                <br>
                Okay, so the system started up but you are not sitting in a graphical <span class="notice">XFCE</span> desktop with the kevux logo in the background.<br>
                In this situation, the most probably cause is that the <span class="notice">Xorg</span> (and therefore XFCE) failed to start.<br>
                The most common cause of this is a video card problem.<br>
                To fix this problem, you will need to manually tell xorg to use your particular video card or use <span class="notice">vesa</span>.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold error">WARNING: This may require some moderate to advanced knowledge of the linux command line and understanding of what your video card specifically is.</span><br>
                <br>
                If the system is not responding then you may need to be able to boot the system without xorg, so add the <span class="notice">xorg=no</span> boot parameter in the grub config at boot time.<br>
                Once you find a way to login you need to edit the <span class="notice">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> file to work with your appropriate video card.<br>
                To add your video card to the xorg.conf file, scroll to the bottom of that file looking for the part that begins with <span class="notice">Section "Device"</span><br>
                Inside of this section, look for the part that begins with <span class="notice">#Driver</span><br>
                Uncomment this line by removing the leading <span class="notice">#</span>.<br>
                On the same line, to the immediate right, you should see something text surrounded in double quotes.<br>
                Replace that text with the appropriate video card driver name.<br>
                If you do not know the proper driver then you will have to do some researching or asking for assistance as determining this is advanced and may be complex.<br>
                You may be able to identify your video card by running the command <span class="notice">lspci</span> and looking for a line that has <span class="notice">VGA Compatible controller</span> or <span class="notice">Display controller</span>.<br>
                <br>
                For the actual login process, see the <span class="notice">Logging In</span> below.<br>
                <br>
                If all else fails and you still cannot get into the system, try booting into maintenance mode by passing the grub command line option: <span class="notice">maintenance</span>.<br>
                However, using maintenance mode almost definitely requires advanced to expert knowledge.<br>
